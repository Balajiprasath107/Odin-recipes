        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The bechamel adds a little something special to this wonderful lasagna.</p>
        <p>I like to use part skim ricotta and mozzarella and low-fat milk to cut some of the fat in this dish. </p>
        <p>You won't notice the difference.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 serving cooking spray</li><br>
            <li>½ pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li><br>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li><br>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li><br>
            <li>2 cups low-fat milk</li><br>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li><br>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li><br>
            <li>1 egg</li><br>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li><br>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li><br>
            <li>2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce, divided</li><br>
            <li>1 (9 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, divided</li><br>
            <li>1 cup chopped cremini mushrooms, divided</li><br>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li><br>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. </p></li><br>
            <li><p>Place the sausage in a skillet over medium heat and cook until browned and </p>
                <p>crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain the sausage and set aside. </p>
            </li><br>
            <li><p>To make bechamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and </p>
                <p>whisk in the flour. Allow the flour and butter to cook until light and foamy, about 2 minutes, whisking constantly; </p>
                <p>2 minutes, whisking constantly; whisk in milk, a little at a time. Whisk in the salt </p>
                <p>and nutmeg and bring the sauce to a bare simmer, whisking constantly until thickened, about 10 minutes.</p>
                <p> Remove sauce from the heat and set aside. </p>
            </li><br>
            <li><p>In a bowl, beat the egg and stir in the ricotta cheese and parsley until thoroughly combined. </p></li><br>
            <li>
                <p>To assemble lasagna, pour about 1 1/2 cup of marinara sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish</p>
                <p>and top the sauce with 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping if necessary.</p>
                <p>On the noodles, layer 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, followed by 1/3 of the cooked sausage,</p>
                <p>1/3 cup of mushrooms, 1/4 of the bechamel sauce, 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup of the Parmesan cheese and 1 more cup of marinara sauce. </p>
                <p>Repeat the layers twice more, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with a layer of marinara sauce, bechamel sauce, the remaining mozzarella cheese,</p>
                <p>and remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with foil. </p>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the noodles are tender, about 1 hour. </p>
                <p>Remove foil and bake until the top cheese layer is browned, about 5 more minutes. Allow the lasagna to stand for 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
